# Quotex App: Is it Real or Fake?

Quotex is an unregulated, offshore binary options platform that lets you
trade over 200 assets across various financial instruments, including
commodities, crypto, stocks, and currency pairs. The broker is focusing
on beginner traders and claims to be an "Innovative platform for smart
investments" with the promise of easy profits, while "making online
trading comfortable and safe".

## Is Quotex a Scam?

Yes, we believe that Quotex is a scam and you should not open an account
with them.

Their trading platform, trading tools and service agreement are designed
to make traders lose money in the long run. Quotex is not regulated by
any financial authorities so it is not a safe and legit broker and
nobody is protecting traders\' interest against shady, unfair business
practices.

Here are some of our strong arguments why we think that Quotex is not a
safe broker:

1.  Not regulated at all
2.  It\'s easy to lose money while trading at Quotex
3.  Misleading marketing tactics and trading tools
4.  Bad reputation, many negative user reviews

## Is Quotex legal?

Quotex is not legal in most countries like the USA, India, Pakistan,
Singapore, Philippines or the European Economic Area, because the broker
is not registered with the local regulatory organizations.

Quotex is technically not illegal and not explicitly banned in South
Africa, but it\'s not regulated by the Financial Sector Conduct
Authority (FSCA), so your capital is not protected, if you are a South
African trader.

### Mobile App

Quotex only offers an official Android App for mobile traders, but it
also faces technical issues, particularly with depositing funds.
\[Quotex does not have an iOS app, a desktop app or an official APK
version you could download\](https://example.com/quotex-app-download/).

So if you really want to trade on Quotex, we suggest you to use the use
the \[official web platform\](https://example.com/quotex-web-version/)
instead of downloading unverified or buggy apps, because it offers a
technically secure, stable, and user-friendly trading environment.

## Account opening

The account opening process is very simple at Quotex. If you want to
open a trading account with them despite our warning, go to their
official website or download their mobile app from the Google Play
Store. Then, follow the steps below:

1.  Enter your e-mail address, choose a password.
2.  Choose the currency you prefer. Available currencies include USD,
    EUR, GBP, PHP, and IDR.
3.  Confirm that you are 18+ years old and not a US citizen/resident.

After creating your trading account, we suggest you to set up 2FA and
other security measurements to \[protect your Quotex account and prevent
unauthorized people from logging
in\](https://example.com/quotex-login/).

## Our rating

\*\*Final Verdict: Not recommended\*\*

We don\'t recommend you to trade at Quotex because it offers nearly the
same features and trading interface as other major binary option
brokers, but with a much higher regulatory risk. Quotex is explicitly
flagged as a scammy broker in many countries like the USA, Portugal,
Brazil or India.

\*\*Regulation & Security: 1/5\*\*

\*\*Effectiveness of features: 2/5\*\*
